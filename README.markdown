LuaD Documentation
===================================
This branch is for the DDoc/CandyDoc generated documentation for LuaD, you can view it online [here](http://jakobovrum.github.com/LuaD/).

Instructions
-----------------------------------
The documentation can be generated by running the included script, `generate.d`, with `rdmd`.
By default, the branch expects to sit in a sub-directory of the LuaD master branch, but you can specify the location of the LuaD master branch with the environment variable `LUAD_PATH` (point to the location of the directory containing the `luad` source package).

Example usage:

    cd your/luad/repository
    git clone -b gh-pages git://github.com/JakobOvrum/LuaD.git docs
	cd docs
	./generate.d
	git commit -am "Updated documentation"
